Analysis of algorithms is the area of computer science that provides tools to analyze the efficiency
of different methods of solutions. Efficiency of an algorithm depends on these parameters; 
i) how much time, 
ii) memory space, 
iii) disk space it requires. 
Analysis of algorithms is mainly used to predict performance and compare algorithms that are developed for the same task. Also it
provides guarantees for performance and helps to understand theoretical basis.

A complete analysis of the running time of an algorithm involves the following steps:
 Implement the algorithm completely.
 Determine the time required for each basic operation.
 Identify unknown quantities that can be used to describe the frequency of execution of the
basic operations.
 Develop a realistic model for the input to the program.
 Analyze the unknown quantities, assuming the modeled input.
 Calculate the total running time by multiplying the time by the frequency for each operation,
then adding all the products.

In this experiment, you will analyze different sorting algorithms and compare their running times
on a number of dataset with changing sizes.
