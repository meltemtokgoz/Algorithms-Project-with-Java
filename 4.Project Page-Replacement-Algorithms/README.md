# Page-Replacement-Algorithms

Algorithm Project with Java-4

In this experiment, you will practice using binary search tree, unordered linked list and priority
queue as heap tree data structures. You are expected to design and implement a program that
will work like a basic page replacement scheme for memory management of operating systems.
The algorithm that you are expected to implement will be a simpler version of FIFO(First In
First Out) and Second Chance Page Replacement Algorithms.
